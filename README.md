In the last question, question11.py:

 To calculate the total payroll for a company using the Employee class
 defined in the oop3.py file of the repository, you can create a Payroll class
 that keeps track of employee instances and computes their total salaries.

 First; Define the Employee Class: Ensuring that the Employee class has an attribute
  for salary and a method to retrieve it.

  Then; Create the Payroll Class: This class will maintain a list of Employee objects
  and provide a method to calculate the total payroll.

  Then Add Employees: When creating employee objects, you can add them to the payroll class.
  Lastly; Calculating Total Payroll: When you need to find the total payroll, the payroll class
  will loop through its list of employees, retrieving each employee's salary and calculating the total.
